Where do you start? There is so much that must happen from the time you show interest in planting a church up through launch day. This church planting tutorial (and our free resources, our online planning system and our full-service support) are all aimed at helping a church planter launch a healthy church. The following provides an overview of the key items that a church planter must deal with through launch (not necessarily completed in this order). You can either follow this church planting tutorial through sequentially by clicking on the buttons in the sidebar (recommended path for completing this tutorial) or you can jump around to a specific topic using the menu on the right.
2. Calling – The first step is to verify your calling. Complete a pre-assessment (self-assessment) and a formal assessment. Pre-assessment involved completing a series of written surveys and reflections about yourself. Learn more…
3. Assessment – Formal assessment is typically a 1-5 day, on-site, in-depth review that culminates in a recommendation regarding your readiness to plant a church. Learn more…', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

The DISC is intended to help you appreciate your preferred role on a team as you work to accomplish tasks. DISC measures four factors of how you behave on a team:
This instrument is quick and easy to take. The intent is to give you a basic idea of where you fall in each of these areas. It is not intended to replace more elaborate and expensive instruments…it is simply a place to begin and to promote discussion within teams. It is necessary to purchase much more psychometrically sound instruments to make decisions of staffing and resourcing teams.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

The Spiritual Gifts assessment is intended to identify your inner passions and motivators outlined in the New Testament (Ephesians 4, Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12-14, 1 Peter 4) as Spiritual Gifts. These giftings are not the same as your calling, however they can significantly impact your calling. For instance, a leader can have any number of the different gifts identified in these four passages, however, the way they lead will be dramatically influenced by their gifts. The best way to determine if you have a gift is to use it in the context of the church. This instrument is a great place to begin to explore areas of potential gifts.
This is a self-report instrument, meaning that you are being asked to report on your own desires and passions. At times it may be helpful to gain the insight of a friend who has seen you in various situations. There are resources given which describe the Biblical basis of each gift and possible indicators and expressions of each gift for this reason.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 2000, NULL, NULL),

The DISC and Spiritual Gifts Assessments each take a snapshot of how you are wired. Using both of these instruments (as well as others) can be helpful in discovering how you are wonderfully and fearfully made.

During World War I the German Army realized the need to determine which soldiers were the best candidates for becoming officers. College diplomas were inadequate as predictors of success, so an assessment process was developed.
Later, large corporations identified a similar need to qualify employees for upper management. Drawing on the German model, a quantifiable process was developed to prepare better leaders for big business.
Industrial psychologists, familiar with military and corporate assessment, have applied a similar assessment process to stemming the tide of attrition in the ranks of foreign missionaries. Placing enthusiastic people in posts for which they were unprepared or unqualified showed itself to be extremely counterproductive and damaging to individuals.
For over a decade, assessment has been used by church planting strategists across North America. Borrowing from experts like Dr. Thomas Graham and Dr. Charles Ridley, a process has been developed to help interested candidates determine their giftedness and readiness for church planting, either as the leader of a team, a member of a team, or as a “solo” church planting pastor.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

Sound familiar? Yes…starting a new church often requires a similar scope of work!
Can you imagine hiring a general contractor with absolutely no home building experience? Most people would never consider it. General contractors typically have years of training and experience. Yet God, in His wisdom, calls most church planters to accomplish a similar scope of work with very little experience (to ensure complete reliance on Him). You need training. You need help.

Suggested initial prayer requests:
As a church planter you should boldly ask people to join the prayer team. Give thought to how you can use prior church experiences and relationships to recruit people. Ask supporting churches to make available e-mail lists/groups to invite people to join in prayer. Be careful not to SPAM or sign-up people who are not interested, but only invite people to join the team. It is much better to provide opt-in opportunities rather than to force people to opt-out. This also increases the likelihood that people on the team are actually concerned and praying for the new church. Recruitment of team members should also include contacting as many friends and relatives as possible and asking them to be part of the team. Each team member should also be asked to recruit additional prayer team members. The goal is to get hundreds (or thousands) of prayer team members actively praying for the new church. The prayer email is a great communication tool for keeping people informed and requesting prayer.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

[bctt tweet=”I decided to find a coach today. Time to up my game! #coachesrule #churchplanting”]
To be most effective, the coach should have personally planted a successful church or have other similar personal experience with church planting. Most likely, you haven’t planted a church before, this experience is a great way for the church planter to learn from someone else’s experience… both good and bad. As can be seen from the list above, the coach also provides support for the Church Planter as a mentor. In addition to overseeing the church plant itself, the coach should monitor the personal and spiritual health of the church planter. This helps ensure that the Church Planter will be able to perform their role well without sacrificing their family or own spiritual well-being.

Choosing the right coach is critical. Sometimes church planting organizations train and select coaches for the church planter. Other times the church planter chooses the coach. Regardless, the church planter must have a coach they respect both personally and professionally and with whom they share fundamental beliefs. As an absolute minimum, the coach should be available for a monthly conference call. A more ideal arrangement is a weekly 1 to 2 hour phone call with the church planter. The coach should commit to working with the Church Planter for 1-3 years.

The approach doesn’t dictate the model. All of these approaches can and do employ various models in order to accomplish their mission of planting healthy churches. Therefore, the question then becomes which approach works best for the church planter based on their situation and calling?
Along with determining their approach a church planter must also determine which model best positions them to accomplish the vision God has placed in their heart and mind. Work through these questions to gain some clarity on models:

Each of these models is unique, but they all have something to offer to the next model (perhaps with the exception of the church split). The decision of which model to employ should take into consideration the community context of the new church, the people it seeks to reach, and the wiring of the planter. It must also be bathed in prayer.

Launch Strategy – The terms launch strategy and church plant proposal are often used interchangeably. At a minimum, a launch strategy is in written form (clear and concise) and answers a number of basic questions including why you are planting, whom you are trying to reach, where the church will be located, who will do it with you, how much it will cost, how will it be funded, what kind of church it will be, how you will gather a core group, and the critical success factors. More detailed strategies (i.e. Marketing Strategy, Outreach Strategy, Fundraising Strategy, Staffing Strategy, etc.) will be articulated in more detail in the overarching Launch Strategy document. We suggest working through your Philosophy of Ministry before finalizing your plan (see next section of the tutorial).
Action Checklist – A written list of actions to be completed during the pre-launch phase through launch. Ideally, each action includes a cost/budget, a date for completion, and a lead person or organization assigned responsibility for its completion. Some church planters turn the action list into an integrated schedule to show the interrelationships between actions (i.e. many actions need to be done in sequence).', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

Launch Strong will help you plan step-by-step with God. For some, planning is something you know you need to do, but you just don’t like to do it. Others may feel like the more you plan, the less spiritual you must be. And some spend so much time thinking and planning that they never actually get much done. Somewhere along the spectrum, there is a Godly way to plan.

Although all healthy churches seek to fulfill the Great Commission, no two churches are exactly alike. Church planters are each called to plant new and unique works as God has placed upon their hearts. Each planter has different passions and priorities. Many characteristics including the style of music, the formality of service, the style of teaching, the use of creativity/multimedia, and the approach to outreach shape and define the personality of the new church. Just as each person has a unique personality with specific likes and dislikes, so will the new church.
The Philosophy of Ministry is one of the most important actions that a church planter completes. Think of the philosophy of ministry as the church’s filter for decision making. The long-term impact of these actions is profound. Fast forward the clock to the new church’s ten year anniversary celebration. A healthy growing church can look back and see how previous decisions were consistently and faithfully made through the filter of this philosophy of ministry. From staffing to facilities, and from service styles to outreach events, decisions are shaped by the philosophy of ministry.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

The picture does not need to be perfect, only roughly right for what you sense God is leading your church to be. Consider the process of building a new house. The first step, before anything else, is to paint a description of the new house. What do you want the finished product to look like? Developing a clear picture of the new house influences nearly every aspect of turning the vision into reality. It affects the selection of a builder, of a lot, of how long it will take to construct, and of the cost. It is very difficult to devlop a plan without a clear vision of the product.
Note: This description of opening day is not the final product. The church will end up looking different than the first draft. This action simply gets you thinking through opening day and setting initial goals.
The Free download on the left, Define What Opening Day Look Like, is a worksheet designed to help you work through specific aspects of Sunday morning (e.g. style of music, signs, food, level of formality, type facility, number of services, etc.).

Step 4 – Get a Federal Identification (Tax ID) Number– An Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, is a nine-digit number that the IRS assigns to business entities. The IRS uses this number to identify taxpayers that are required to file various business tax returns. EINs are used by employers, sole proprietors, corporations, partnerships, non-profit organizations, trusts and estates, government agencies, certain individuals and other business entities. The process of obtaining a Federal Tax Number is very simple and it’s FREE (one of the few steps in the process that is free). Click here to apply online via the IRS web site. It’s painless and required for your 501(c)(3) submission.
Step 5 – Establish a Church Checking Account– Armed with the products from steps 1-4 above, you can open a business checking account. Many banks offer a free (no fees) checking account to non-profit organizations. The bank may want to see either your 501(c)(3) application or your tax exempt approval letter from the IRS to set the account up as a non-profit. You can initially set the account up as a regular account and then change it to non-profit at a later time (if required while waiting on your 501(c)(3) submission). Opening an account will usually take two trips to the bank. One visit to obtain the application form and a second to submit the form. In most cases, your designated Board will need a signed resolution to establish the account.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 2000, NULL, NULL),

How would Jesus market the church? Does it work? Is it necessary? Is it biblical, or is it fighting the battle with weapons of the world? Is it worth my time? Is it worth the expense? Is it too high risk? What if we spend $10,000 and no one responds? What kind of person comes to church because of a card in the mail?
Marketing the church demands time, thought, planning, and coordination. It’s expensive and risky. Wouldn’t it be more spiritual—and easier—to kneel and pray three hours a day and accept the people God sends?
Journey Christian Church (located in Tampa, Florida) had been meeting for several weeks when we had our first “Discover Journey” class in the fall of 1999. Thirty adults had showed up for our first class. They were each asked, “How did you hear about Journey?” Over twenty of the thirty people there responded that they had received a card in the mail. Of those thirty people, twenty-six had not been to church for at least two years, over twenty had not been to church regularly for at least ten years, and many had never attended church.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

Mention marketing of the church to a group of Christians and you’re likely to stir up a lively, if not, heated debate. Read the following email received by Church Marketing Solutions:
For some, marketing the church is associated with shady practices involving selling, exchanging money, and making profits. Consider the following definition:
To add fuel to the fire, consider John 2:14-15 where we see Jesus’ response to businessmen who turned the temple courts into a profit making market (business):
What is at the heart of Jesus’ strong response? Is it the fact that these men were opportunistic? Being opportunistic is not the problem; their motivation behind the opportunity is the problem. Unfortunately, their motive was making money and had little to do with God’s agenda.
Church marketing is all about building bridges to lost people so they can hear the gospel message. This is why, among the Christian community, church planters and new churches have been the most willing to accept church marketing. Without a doubt, marketing is one of the most important steps a new church plant can take in communicating the Good News of Jesus Christ with the culture in which it lives.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 2000, NULL, NULL),

According to research by Thom Rainer, “most Americans have never been invited to church—never. Yet, 82% indicate that they would be at least ‘somewhat likely’ to attend if invited.”
Most experts on reaching people for Christ agree that the most effective form of evangelism is friendship evangelism. The purpose of new church marketing isn’t to stick a card in someone’s hand and expect they will want a relationship with Christ and then to be baptized a week later. Effective marketing opens the door to a possible relationship. It connects a church with people who need to be pastored before they realize they need pastoring.
Everyone is spiritually restless until they connect with God. When crisis or life-transition exposes the restlessness, where will the unchurched person turn? They will probably reach out to the church that’s been pastoring them from a safe distance.
If the most effective means of reaching lost people is through personal invitation, how do marketing techniques such as mass mailings continue to make such an impact? Simply this: the purpose of every marketing touch is to make it easier for Christians to start a spiritual conversation with their neighbors. Church events that address children, marriage, or finances, for example, attract individuals to church who might otherwise not attend a Sunday service. When postcards go out, ask your launch team to pray as well as to ask their friends or co-workers if they saw the cards in the mail. Often, people with no other connection with the church will receive a series of cards, and later will begin a conversation with someone connected with the church. The bridge for a spiritual conversation has already been constructed, making it less intimidating for the newcomer to take the next step.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 3000, NULL, NULL),

Every church markets. In his letter to Titus, Paul instructs Christians to conduct themselves “so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive” (Titus 2:10). Everything the church does makes the teachings of Jesus either more or less attractive. Some market intentionally, while others market unwittingly. Some market a message they want people to hear. Some market a message that pushes people away. Do you have a church sign? If yes, then you are marketing. What about a logo, newsletter, meeting space, or even a worship service? Each is a marketing tool. Marketing may not be the primary motivation or objective of all you do, but everything you do markets the church.
For instance, what images do these church names conjure—Adventure Church, Journey, The Meeting Place, The Well, ForeFront? Or maybe Boring Christian Church, Holy Spirit Church, Apostolic Church, Covenant Church, The Chosen Church? Get the point? At New Life Christian Church (located in Centreville, Virginia), people sometimes say, “I saw your name, and that’s what I need—new life.” From the moment the church selects a name, everything the church does either helps people take a step closer to Jesus or creates a barrier for the gospel.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 4000, NULL, NULL),

Many marketing experts propose that it takes, “Six to stick.” A consumer needs to be touched at least six times before he or she considers buying a product. At Journey, we believe it takes even more “touches” for unchurched and irreligious people to consider giving church a chance.
The strategy included a several month detailed plan as we tried to establish identity in north Tampa. We studied and researched our context intensely in order to understand how our target group thought, shopped, and what their felt-needs were. Before you spend money on advertising or brainstorming, hire a graphic artist, or start designing logos on napkins, please do the hard, but rewarding work of developing a new church marketing plan.
Jay Conrad Levinson, the author of the Guerilla Marketing series of books, suggests you begin with a simple marketing plan. “The plan has only seven sentences. It should be that brief because you’ll be forced to focus on your objectives and tactics and because brief marketing plans should be easy to understand when read by your employees or partners.” I suggest that churches state marketing intentions in 5 sentences, especially since competition is not a factor.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 7000, NULL, NULL),

Church marketing isn’t business marketing. If a margarine maker over-promises and under-delivers, your trust in that company won’t be significantly impacted. You may even buy their product if it’s on sale next week. However, if a church makes promises and then doesn’t deliver, its integrity is at stake in the eye of the newcomer, and he or she may never return. Obviously, integrity expectations for those selling butter and toasters differs dramatically from expectations for churches—and justifiably so.
Integrity in church marketing means honestly representing who you are. If your children’s ministry stinks, don’t quote parents saying it’s the nation’s best. If your worship team is just this side of senior citizenship, then don’t produce radio spots proclaiming Britney Spears-style worship. When who you proclaim to be matches who you really are, it builds credibility and honors God. Misleading expectations, however, leave the first-timer disappointed, with little chance of a return visit.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 8000, NULL, NULL),

Most church planters today do a mass mailing. In recent years, it has proven to be the most efficient method to repeatedly touch your target group. In our experience a four-card mailing to 30,000 homes will likely result in at least 150 first-time guests to your new church. So, for most church planters, mass mailing is the most important idea.[bctt tweet=”It takes six to stick…time to get marketing! #churchplanting”] After that, the effectiveness of other marketing techniques varies greatly depending on your context, style, purpose, and budget.
Don’t just try some ideas. Try lots of ideas. Church planting veteran John Wasem says, “Don’t put all your marketing eggs in one basket.” Remember, the marketing rule of thumb—“It takes six to stick.” A consumer needs at least six touches before he or she considers a product. For irreligious people, it may demand more than that. So, give it time. Years may pass before the new church fully realizes the harvest of its first outreach events and cards. But, with God’s involvement, the harvest is sure. God is the Hound of Heaven, pursing people on the run. He is a sending God, and He expects to be reconciled with lost people. When God prepares a heart, and the church’s marketing touches reach that person repeatedly over a period of time, it creates an opening for potential relationship.

A word of caution—the more money you budget for a new church marketing plan, the more research will be required to spend it efficiently. For example, in Tampa radio advertising on a couple popular radio stations seemed to be the most effective means of reaching our target group. Yet, the average spot on a radio station costs $80 per thirty second commercial if you buy a bundle of slots. To run a similar spot on MTV, CNBC, Lifetime, Discovery, and other channels often costs less than $10 per spot when buying in volume. Therefore, we had to determine if the radio ads were worth at least eight times as much as the cable television ads. If you are going to spend thousands of dollars on radio advertising, first consider if you can achieve better saturation of your context for fewer dollars in a different medium.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 13000, NULL, NULL),

No matter what marketing tools you use, don’t rely on them as the way people will hear about your church. View your marketing efforts and tools as a way to empower your people to have conversations with friends, family, neighbors, co-workers about faith and the church. That means you’re going to need to train your people to do this.
Unfortunately some churches send out postcards every year and think they’ve done their job inviting people into faith.

Steve and Laura were living life to the fullest. Each had a great job that paid well. They had a four thousand square foot house, a dog, and two happy children. They were members of various country clubs and fitness centers and vacationed regularly at ski resorts throughout the country. Life was unfolding nicely, but Steve and Laura had little use for church.
Then during one doctor’s appointment Steve was diagnosed, after a series of tests, with a brain tumor. God got Steve and Laura’s attention. They became interested in spiritual things and remembered receiving post cards from a new church. Laura remembered seeing banners outside a school on Sunday morning identifying the church’s location. Steve and Laura showed up for church one Sunday morning, found Jesus, were baptized into Christ, and experienced the love of that community of faith.
Six months later Steve died. His funeral was a celebration of Steve’s graduation into a Christ-filled eternity. Where would Steve and Laura have been without the church marketing of one new church that cared enough to reach their community through a marketing plan? Marketing is all about reaching people like Steve and Laura. There are millions of individuals and families in all walks of life still out there waiting to hear the Good News of Jesus Christ.

The larger the population of the community, the more surveys you will want to receive to get a good sampling. As you collect the surveys you will begin to see trends emerging as to what the greatest strengths and weaknesses of the community are.
In the sample survey, you will notice that a gift was given away for those who participated. This provides incentive for people to fill out the survey. It also gives you a reason to have additional contact with them through email. One strategy is to use the survey as a means to collect emails for a community database. Then when community service initiatives are done by the church, those who participated in the survey can be invited to serve.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

Outreach events take on many shapes and sizes. The list of possible events is far larger than the actual number that can be conducted. It is important to prioritize the events and identify a strategy that will provide the greatest impact for the limited resources available. It starts with identifying possible events and setting an expectation for how many events you will do. Develop three different lists: 1) events, 2) classes/seminars and 3) service projects. We recommend one or two events per month for each of the six months prior to launch. Some events will target specific neighborhoods while others target entire towns.
Events. Consider at least 3 different types of events:
Classes/Seminars. These typically target specific community-felt needs within the target demographic and can target large or small groups of people. Examples include:
Service Projects. Typically smaller scale and low cost, service projects are aimed at localized groups of people.

An outreach strategy and a marketing strategy are closely linked. Each outreach event is an opportunity for marketing. In most cases, a new church can get at least 3-5 positive name touches in the local community where the event is being conducted (e.g. flyers, signs, newsletters, invitations, etc.). An outreach strategy should be closely coordinated with the new church’s marketing strategy.
DO NOT RELY ON MARKETING FOR NAME RECOGNITION.
One of the biggest mistakes that new churches make is not aggressively using outreach events to establish name recognition in the community. Too many church planters rely on marketing to establish name recognition. Outreach events are far more effective at branding when used in conjunction with marketing.

Developing a written plan forces the discipline of looking for innovative ways to get into the community. Since the list of possible outreach events is endless, you need to prioritize and filter through the list and decide what events to actually accomplish.
Here are a few considerations in developing your filter:
We encourage you to plan a balanced mix of these different size events. For example, in each of the three months prior to your launch date, have a community event and plan one large regional event the weekend before the grand opening Sunday. In addition to these community and regional events, consider challenging your launch team to each take ownership for local neighborhood events.
The outcome of 1-4 above is a filter through which you decide what events to accomplish during the prenatal phase–before your church is officially launched.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 6000, NULL, NULL),

Things that get measured get done so have a plan with real goals. After the event is done, meet with your team and evaluate how you did then set (or reset) your goals for the next event. Learn from your success and miscues. Remember that church name recognition in the community is strongly dependent on the number of outreach and service events you conduct in the six months prior to launch. Set demanding expectations for the number of events you will do, stretch yourself or you will end up looking back and wishing you had done more outreach events. As mentioned earlier, we strongly recommend you hold one or two major events in each of the four months prior to launch. This will result in six major events leading up to your launch day — consistent with the marketing philosophy of ‘six to stick’. Set the expectation for every staff person or every family on the launch team to host at least one of these events.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 7000, NULL, NULL),

We live at a time when more churches are either stagnant or dying than are being started or growing. Such a time as this for change. The church is called to be the light of the world and to live out the Great Commandment (love God, love people) and the Great Commission (reach the lost, grow disciples). God does not intend for His church to be powerless in the community.
When a church’s leadership team becomes convicted that things must change, the first step is most often to consider questions like “how do we turn things around…how do we revitalize…how do we change our culture…how do we get our members taking ownership…how do we become more relevant…how do we become more outreach focused…how do we grow?” In some cases, churches decide the best thing for the Kingdom is to shutdown and use the church’s assets to start a brand new work (a new church plant).', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 1000, NULL, NULL),

In discerning the best path for your church, start with an inventory of your strengths. What do you do really well? What are your best assets (e.g. facilities, location, equipment, leaders, key community influencers attending, etc)? Make a list. Be candid. This assessment should identify your strengths as the average church leader in your community, state or nation would see them…not as you see them relative to yourself. For example, you may feel that your leadership team is one of your relative strengths when in fact it is weak compared with the average healthy growing church. On the other hand, you may own a facility is one of the best locations in town…by anyone’s standards including many businesses that would pay top dollars for your property. Call this a strength if it would be broadly recognized by the average person as a strength.', 'template', 'c7c589c3-86fb-4c1d-ae75-167df5c79463', 3000, NULL, NULL),

Do the same inventory with your weaknesses as you did with your strengths. No matter what path of change you take (option 1 through 4 above), trust that God wants to do a new thing in you. The question becomes “how does God want to use us to do a new thing?” Look hard at your strengths and weaknesses. Pray. Check your motives. What is driving your decision making? What is the likelihood of success? Is there broad and compelling ownership / buy-in by your key decision makers for the path being chosen? What will the different options cost to do them effectively? Are you willing to make the investment? Do you have the right leadership (the toughest question you will face)? Are you relying on your leadership to perform at a level markedly above where they’ve been in the past?
