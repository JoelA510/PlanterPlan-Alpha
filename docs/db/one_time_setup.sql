-- One-time Database Setup
-- Use this file for scripts that should run only once and are NOT idempotent schema definitions.
-- Examples: Data patches, destructive renames, or initialization of static data that shouldn't be re-seeded.

-- Currently empty as all schema definitions have been consolidated into schema.sql
-- and specific seed data is in supabase/seeds/.
