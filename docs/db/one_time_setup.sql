-- One-time Database Setup
-- Use this file for scripts that should run only once and are NOT idempotent schema definitions.
-- Examples: Data patches, destructive renames, or initialization of static data that shouldn't be re-seeded.

-- CURRENT STATUS:
-- All schema definitions (Tables, Views, Functions, Policies) are consolidated in `docs/db/schema.sql`.
-- Initial data seeding is handled by `supabase/seeds/`.

-- If you need to run specific data patches, add them here.
