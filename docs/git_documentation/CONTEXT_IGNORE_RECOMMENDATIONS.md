# Context Ignore Recommendations

The following files are generated or tracked for AI context and historical record keeping, but are not critical for a human code review of the current feature set. They can be safely ignored or deprioritized by reviewers to save context/focus.

- **`docs/git_documentation/PR_DESCRIPTION_DRAFT.md`**: Draft content for the PR description.
- **`DEBT_REPORT.md`**: A comprehensive log of technical debt and linting issues.
- **`docs/operations/ENGINEERING_KNOWLEDGE.md`**: A cumulative knowledge base of lessons learned; only the most recent additions are relevant to the current PR.
- **`TEST_PLAN.md.resolved`**: The resolved plan for testing; useful for verification history but not code logic.
