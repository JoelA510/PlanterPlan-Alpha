# 🚀 Feature: Vite & Tailwind v4 Infrastructure Migration

## 📋 Summary
This PR executes a massive infrastructure modernization, migrating the entire codebase from Create React App (Webpack 5) to **Vite** and upgrading from Tailwind CSS v3 to **Tailwind CSS v4**. It also integrates the **Base44** feature set (Premium Dashboard, Projects, Reports) into the main application structure, hybridizing legacy features with new architectural patterns.

- **Fast Build Chain**: Replaced `react-scripts` with `vite` (dev start <300ms vs 30s).
- **Modern Styling**: Adopted Tailwind v4 (CSS-first configuration via `@theme`) and standardized the Design System (Slate/Brand colors).
- **Feature Convergence**: Merged "Session Work" (Base44 components) into the upstream `feature/infrastructure/vite-migration-v2` branch.
- **Quality Assurance**: Fixed critical regressions (Sidebar navigation, Layout wiring) and passed adversarial browser verification.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This PR includes **154 changed files** with **10k+ insertions** and **20k+ deletions**. It is a foundational rewrite of the frontend build system and directory structure.

## 🛣️ Roadmap Progress

| Status | ID | Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ | **INFRA-VITE** | Vite Migration | Migrate from CRA to Vite for faster HMR & Builds |
| ✅ | **INFRA-TW4** | Tailwind v4 | Upgrade to Tailwind v4 with CSS-native config |
| ✅ | **FE-BASE44** | Base44 Integration | Merge Premium features (Dashboard, Reports) |
| ✅ | **UX-NAV** | Responsive Navigation | Fix Sidebar mobile interactions and persistence |

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### 1. Build System: Vite + Vitest
We moved from Webpack to Vite.
- **Why**: Semantic versioning issues with CRA, slow start times.
- **Changes**: `vite.config.js` added with aliases (`@app`, `@features`, `@shared`) matching FSD.
- **Testing**: Migrated Jest to Vitest (compatible API, faster execution).

### 2. Styling: Tailwind v4
We removed `tailwind.config.js` in favor of CSS-first configuration.
- **Global Theme**: Defined `--color-brand-*` and `--color-slate-*` in `src/styles/globals.css`.
- **Legacy Support**: Kept `index.css` as the entry point but refactored imports to use `@import "tailwindcss";`.

### 3. Layout Inversion
We enforced `DashboardLayout.jsx` as the owner of navigation state.
- **Pattern**: Pages (`Dashboard.jsx`, `Reports.jsx`) now pass `SideNav` as a prop to `DashboardLayout`.
- **Fix**: Prevents "Missing Sidebar" bugs where pages rendered naked content.

## 🔍 Review Guide

### 🚨 High Risk (Infrastructure)
- `package.json`: Dependency overhaul (Vite, TW4, Vitest).
- `vite.config.js`: Path aliases and build settings.
- `src/main.jsx`: New entry point (replaced `index.js`).
- `src/styles/globals.css`: The "Truth" for design tokens.

### ⚠️ Medium Risk (Core Features)
- `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.jsx`: Core layout logic.
- `src/app/App.jsx`: Routing and Context orchestration.
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`: Main verified page.

### ℹ️ Low Risk (Components)
- `src/components/ui/*.jsx`: Shadcn/Radix wrappers (mostly automated updates).

## 🧪 Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
```bash
npm run test           # Run Vitest suite (Golden Paths)
npm run lint           # Check for code style issues
```

### Manual Verification (Browser)
1. **Boot**: Run `npm run dev`. App should load in <500ms.
2. **Dashboard**: Navigate to `/dashboard`. Verify Sidebar lists "Your Projects".
3. **Reports**: Click "Reports". Verify Charts load and Sidebar persists.
4. **Mobile**: Resize to <1024px. Verify Hamburger menu toggles Sidebar overlay.
