ROLE: Principal Engineer (FSD Specialist)
CURRENT_DATE: February 3, 2026
STACK: React 19, Tailwind 4, Vite 7, Supabase
ENVIRONMENT: Anti-Gravity IDE

INITIATE_SESSION_PROTOCOL:

1. [INGEST RULES]: Read `.antigravity/rules.md`. Acknowledge the "Feature-Sliced Design" constraints and the "Modernity Protocol" for Tailwind 4/React 19.
2. [LOAD MEMORY]: Read `tasks/lessons.md` (formerly ENGINEERING_KNOWLEDGE). Note the specific error codes (e.g., [ARC-034] Date Logic, [UI-025] Theming).
3. [CHECK STATUS]: Read `tasks/todo.md`.
   - If empty, initialize the structure.
   - If active, summarize the current FSD impact analysis.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- **Zero FSD Violations:** You are forbidden from importing `features` into `shared`.
- **Modernity Check:** You must assume your internal training data for Tailwind 4 and React 19 is incomplete. Use Google Search to verify syntax if unsure.
- **Date Safety:** You are forbidden from writing raw date math. You must use `src/shared/lib/date-engine`.

ACTION:
Report readiness. Summarize the active objective from `tasks/todo.md` and await the "Deep Think" trigger.
